# vinyl-roulette
Vinyl Roulette simulates the YouTube show "Rythm Roulette" using spotify API! 

It will select a random seed from the seed artist-track combo provided by the initial array and give you a random song to sample

This is for the beatmaking community

Future updates:
- Main genres will be jazz/bosa/fusion jazz/samba/acid jazz/experimental jazz.
- User will be able to provide their own seed-tracks combo if they want to.
- This code will be accessed from a website, where you can play your track from the browser's spotify web player.
- I need to refine which artist seeds/tracks ill be using for each genre, because right now i get some random stuff going.
- From terminal it will open the spotify's song url on my browser
